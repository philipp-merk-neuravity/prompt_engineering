**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete `has_close_elements`
function. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge, and Large Scale scenarios to ensure the code's
robustness, reliability, and scalability.
**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the `has_close_elements` function under normal
conditions.
**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.
**3. Large Scale Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To assess the functionâ€™s performance and scalability with large data samples.
**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
- For large-scale tests, focus on the function's efficiency and performance under heavy loads.

 Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
